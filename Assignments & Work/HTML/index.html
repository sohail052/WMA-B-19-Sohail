    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
    <p>
      Last <strong>Sunday morning</strong>, our society’s cricket club gathered
      for what turned out to be one of the most memorable matches I have ever
      played. It was a <em>hard-ball</em> game starting from
      <time>10:00 a.m.</time> till <time>1:00 p.m.</time>. We
      <strong>won the toss</strong> and decided to <b>bat first</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, our <abbr title="Opening batsman">Opener</abbr> got out on
      a <q>duck</q>, and the top order collapsed quickly. After just
      <strong>6.4 overs</strong>, our scorecard showed <strong>47/7</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>The Turning Point</h2>

    <p>
      I was a <em>lower-order batsman</em>, and it was my turn to face the
      music. At first, I played cautiously, defending and rotating strike to
      settle down. Slowly, I started timing the ball well — playing
      <i>confident flicks</i> and clean <b>cover drives</b> for fours. Once I
      was set, I even played some <em>lofted shots</em> over the ropes for
      sixes!
    </p>

    <p>
      As the innings progressed, one of my teammates shouted from the boundary,
      <q>Just play your natural game, Sohail!</q> — and that single line boosted
      my confidence.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "Cricket isn’t just about runs and wickets — it’s about the courage to
      stand tall when your team needs you the most."
    </blockquote>

    By the end of my innings, my strike rate had reached 148<sup>.83</sup>, and
    our run rate climbed from 4<sub>.7</sub> to 7<sub>.6</sub> per over — a
    massive turnaround that changed the match completely.

    <p>
      With <strong>8 fours</strong> and <strong>3 sixes</strong>, I scored
      <b>64 runs off 43 balls</b>, including 12 dot balls and 20 singles and
      doubles. By the end of 20 overs, our team reached a solid total of
      <strong>152/9</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>The Bowling Brilliance</h2>
    <p>
      After lunch, we came to bowl with full energy. Our bowlers hit the right
      areas, and our fielders supported brilliantly. The opposition started
      losing wickets rapidly. Eventually, we bowled them all out in
      <strong>13 overs</strong> for just <strong>104 runs</strong>.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Our opening bowler took 3 wickets.</li>
      <li>Spinners choked the middle overs.</li>
      <li>Our fielders saved at least 20 runs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We won the match by a comfortable margin of <strong>48 runs</strong>. The
      whole team celebrated as if we had won a final.

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>
      That match taught me a valuable life lesson — <em>never give up</em> no
      matter how hopeless things seem. Cricket, much like life, rewards patience
      and determination. This was not just a victory for our team; it was a
      victory for belief, courage, and unity.
